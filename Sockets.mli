(** [sto64b s] initializes a 64-byte sequence full of the [Space] characters,
    converts [s] to a byte sequence, and copies the byte form of [s] to the 
    [Space] filled byte sequence starting at byte 0.

    spectators for and gives the user his IP Address and the socket port 
    number to give to spectators.*)

(** [conn_client fd] prompts the user to enter an IP Address and port number
    and creates a socket address out of them, then tries to connect the 
    socket bound to by [fd] to a listening socket at that address. *)

(** [init_spectators fd num] forks [num] processes and sets them up to listen
    for spectators. When a child process connects to a spectator, the child 
    plays the game being spectated up to the currect move and continues showing 
    subsequent moves as they happen. A pipe is used to communicate between the
    parent and listening child processes, and a list of both ends of each pipe
    is returned. *)
